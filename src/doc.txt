5. Validation of Results
Status: ✅ Done.
Method: The validate_results() function is used to compare results from all implementations against the ground truth computed using the ijk serial algorithm.
6. Performance Measurements
Status: ✅ Done in main.c.
Method:
You measure execution times for all serial and parallel versions using omp_get_wtime().
Speedup calculations are included for parallel versions relative to their serial counterparts.
Presentation: You log results to a CSV file (matrix_mult_results_fopenmp.csv) for easy analysis.
7. Block Size Experiments
Status: ✅ Done.
Approach:
Tested block sizes (e.g., 16, 32, 64, 128, 256) for both serial and parallel versions.
Recorded and analyzed the impact of block size on performance.
Ensured support for non-even divisibility by block size.
What to Discuss in Your Report
Matrix Multiplication Variants:

Explain the six loop order permutations (ijk, ikj, jik, jki, kij, kji).
Discuss why loop order affects performance (e.g., cache locality, memory access patterns).
Blocked Matrix Multiplication:

Describe the purpose of blocking (to improve cache usage).
Explain how you handle cases where N is not evenly divisible by the block size.
Validation Process:

Highlight how validate_results() ensures correctness by comparing with the ijk ground truth.
Mention that results are considered valid if they are within the EPSILON tolerance.
Performance Analysis:

Present performance results from your CSV file for:
Serial versions of all six algorithms.
Parallel versions of all six algorithms.
Serial and parallel blocked versions with different block sizes.
Compare execution times and speedups.
Identify the best-performing serial and parallel variants.
Analyze the impact of block size on performance (e.g., finding an optimal block size).
Parallel Performance:

Discuss the scalability of parallel implementations (e.g., speedup vs. number of threads).
Explain any observed bottlenecks (e.g., synchronization, memory bandwidth).
Challenges and Learnings:

Highlight challenges faced during implementation, such as handling non-even divisibility for block size.
Discuss insights gained about matrix multiplication optimizations and OpenMP.
Additional Recommendations
Test on Multiple Matrix Sizes: Ensure you've tested across the full range of sizes (1000 to 3000) specified in the problem description.
Optimize for Your Hardware: Discuss how the results are influenced by your computer's architecture (e.g., cache size, core count).
Graphs: Include visualizations (e.g., bar charts or line graphs) for:
Execution times for different algorithms and matrix sizes.
Speedup of parallel versions compared to serial.
Impact of block size on performance.
